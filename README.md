Hi there! 

üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:

With nearly eight years of specialized experience in software quality assurance, both in automation and manual testing, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and support the delivery of top-tier software solutions.
Throughout my professional journey, I have demonstrated exceptional analytical skills and a steadfast commitment to ensuring software quality. My current tenure at Reputed Bank in Singapore, with employed by TechnoPals, has been particularly formative. There, I enhanced software quality and processes, developed and maintained UI automation frameworks using Serenity, Java, and Selenium, and conducted comprehensive manual testing to validate software performance and reliability. My efforts have significantly increased test automation coverage and ensured high-quality outcomes.

In addition to my employment with at Technopals, my previous positions at Wiley Global Technologies, Pearson Lanka, and DMS Pvt Ltd have further honed my skills. At Wiley Global Technologies, I implemented an API automation framework using Rest Assured, TestNG, and Java, achieving over 90% automation coverage for the project. I also introduced code coverage measurement techniques using Jacoco, ensuring comprehensive testing and quality assurance. These experiences have equipped me with a robust understanding of various testing methodologies and tools, including Selenium, TestNG, Junit, Postman, and Fiddler.

My technical proficiencies extend to programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as test automation frameworks like Selenium, Serenity Framework, and Jmeter. I am adept at using test management tools like Testrail, HP ALM, and Zephyr, and have experience with various development strategies and source control systems. My background in testing methodologies, test management, and defect management, coupled with my strong problem-solving skills, positions me as a valuable asset to your team.

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology from the University of Moratuwa and am an ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL). These qualifications, along with my hands-on experience, have equipped me with the knowledge and expertise required to excel in the field of software quality engineering.
